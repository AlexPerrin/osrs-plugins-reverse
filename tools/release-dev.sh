# VERSION (repo root) holds the next official version; N counts the dev builds of it (1, 2, ...).
# Dev builds are automated (user, 2026-10-19); official releases vX.Y.Z need the release gate record
# qa/client-X.Y.Z.md (checked by the osrs-harness repo's hooks/publish_gate.py). The checks here are machine checks only:
#   - master is clean and equal to origin/main (the build is of a pushed commit);
#   - the repack log has all 7 `telemetry:` lines (patch_telemetry.py asserts exactly one match each);
#   - the APKs carry no secrets or personal data (private keys, the server's RSA private exponent, the
#     user's name or email, home paths, keystores).
# The release attaches the full repacked APKs (user's decision, 2026-10-19) and THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md (the
# licence notices for the third-party code in libosrsrl.so and its host.jar).

Automated dev build of \`master\` at \`${sha:0:9}\`. Not a gated release: the official releases (\`vX.Y.Z\`)
are checked by client QA on a device; dev builds pass only the build's machine checks (telemetry patches
present, no secrets in the APKs).

**What it is.** The official Old School RuneScape Android app (build 241.4), repacked to load this repo's
\`libosrsrl.so\` and RuneLite plugin host. It connects only to an OpenRune test server
(\`10.0.2.2:43594\`, the host as seen from an emulator such as BlueStacks) and signs in with the server's local
sign-in (LOCAL_AUTH); it cannot sign in to Jagex. The app's analytics (Singular, Firebase, Crashlytics) and the
consent sync are patched out (docs/app-telemetry.md). Signed with the repo's debug key.

**Licences.** \`THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md\` (attached) lists the third-party code inside \`libosrsrl.so\` and its
embedded plugin host (Dear ImGui, the RuneLite client subset and API, Guice, Guava, OkHttp, protobuf-javalite, ...)
with their copyright notices and licence texts. The rest of the APK is Jagex's Old School RuneScape app, which
those licences don't cover.

**Install** (both files, as one app):
