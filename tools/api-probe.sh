# Runtime probe of the RuneLite API in the Android app (goal client-api):
#   ANDROID_SERIAL=<your own instance> tools/api-probe.sh [out-dir]   (default ~/osrs-harness/evidence/client-api)
# The app must run this repo's build (host.jar carries osrsrl-build.txt and api-native.txt) and be logged in on
# the test server. Builds the probe jar (host/plugins/api-probe), pushes it to plugins/, has the running host
# load it (`debug.osrsrl.set 'load api-probe.jar <n>'`), waits for its report, pulls it to
# <out-dir>/api-probe.tsv, removes the jar and the report from the device by name and prints one line:
# pass / denominator. The denominator is every abstract method of every net.runelite.api interface in
# re/runelite/runelite-api-1.13.1.jar, less the interfaces the report's header lists as excluded.
# The probe stays loaded in the app until it restarts; it has unregistered itself by then.
# State the probe reaches only when set up first: a fight running (Hitsplat; a wielded scythe of vitur adds a
# map spotanim per swing for GraphicsObject; `::npc 1000 poh_combat_dummy_npc` is a target that lasts; while the
# player is interacting and no hitsplat has come, the probe waits for one), the world map open while it runs
# (WorldMapRegion/Icon, setWorldMapPositionTarget), a song playing (MidiRequest) and ambient sounds in range
# (Lumbridge's goblin field). The menu draw rows pass with a long-press menu open or with none.
# Instances that appear only while it runs are waited for when named in `debug.osrsrl.probewait` (comma-separated
# interface names): PendingLogin (log a listed friend in or out on another client while it runs: the notice lives
# ~5 s), Script (open a tab whose script raises a RuneLite callback, e.g. the skills tab: skillTabTotalLevel).
# HealthBarConfig comes from the fight's head bars, DynamicObject from an animated loc in the scene.
# Last, one at a time: closeInterface closes the open modal client-side ("modal" in probewait: it waits for one, e.g.
# equipment stats), menuAction walks onto the player's own tile (the server closes the modal too; the fight stops),
# setGameState(LOADING) reloads the scene (a ground object it removed comes back). The session and world stay as they are.
